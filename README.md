### Tomislav PintariÄ‡
I am a geographer and researcher passionate about GIS technologies and strategic, spatial, regional, and urban planning. I have experience in various consulting fields, including strategic planning, regional and urban development consulting, GIS analysis, Technical Assistance, and EU funds management.
My professional interests have recently expanded to encompass ESRI's GIS solutions, such as ArcGIS Experience Builder, ArcGIS Web App Builder, ArcGIS Dashboards, and ArcGIS Hub. I am also deeply interested in business intelligence (BI), data analytics, and open spatial data processing. I occasionally utilize various programming solutions, including QGIS, GeoServer, MS POWER BI, SQL and Python (Jupyter Notebook).
